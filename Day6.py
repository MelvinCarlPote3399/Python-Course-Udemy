# Day 6 --> Functions, Code Blocks, and While Loops

### Defining and calling functions

# functions consist of a name, followed by parameters

# functions start with 'def' keyword, followed by a function name, then parentheses

# function won't do anything until we call it

# Define function
# def my_function():
#    print("Hello")
#    print("Bye")

# my_function()

# Functions reduce the amount of code required to perform a task

### While loops --> will run until a condition is deemed false

# While syntax:
# while (condition; condition must be true):
#   do this
#   do this
